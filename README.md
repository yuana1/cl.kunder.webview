# cl.kunder.webview

This webview is totally independent from the main webview, but allows you tu access plugins and other Cordova resources.

It's possible to modify this plugin to allow multiple webviews.

Report issues on [github issue tracker](https://github.com/kunder-lab/cl.kunder.webview/issues)

## Installation
```
    cordova plugin add github.com/kunder-lab/cl.kunder.webview.git
```

## Supported Platforms
- Android
- iOS


## Quick Start

To open a new webview, just call in your app's js:
```javascript
    webview.Show(URL);
```

Where `URL` is the path to the page to be opened. In Android, the plugin automatically adds the prefix `file:///android_asset/www/`
But only if no `*://` or `javascript:` is present at the front of the URL.

Then, to close the second webview and return to the main view, call in your second webview (the opened webview, not the main webview):
```javascript
    webview.Close(data); //data json object
```

This will close and destroy the second webview.

# webView

The `webView`object provides a way to manage a second webview inside your cordova app. This could be usefull if you want to open a second page as a popup or you want to load new content that is totally unrelated to the main view, but still have the ability to use cordova plugins.

The main difference with inAppBrowser plugin is that cl.kunder.webview plugin can access and use all cordova plguins installed in your app.
